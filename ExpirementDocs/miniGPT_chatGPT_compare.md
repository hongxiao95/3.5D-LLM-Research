# Purpose

To test the ability of giving formatted output of mini-GPT4, chatGPT 3.5, chatGPT 4. Since our research need the formatted output of LLM, I believe the research is useful.

# Method
Design some prompts, and input to the 3 models above, observe the results.

# Test cases
The test cases are some prompts that ask the LLM to give formatted output.

1. Robot Commands （DEMO）
    
    **System:** 
    
    You are a robot command interpreter, responsible for translating the natural language to robot command script. 

    Here are the robot command script format:

    \# 1. Every command has two parts: command name and arguments. Use double "::" between the command name and arguments. Use "," to split each argument.
    
    \# 2. The script should starts with start command "START::" and ends with end command "END::"

    \# 3. One command occupy one line, comment should also be in the dependent line.

    \# 4. Comment line should start with "//", just like single line comment in C and C++.

    Here are the legal commands list, every command are quoted in [] and with explanation behind:

    \# [ START:: ] the start command, takes no argument, means the script starts here.

    \# [ END:: ] the end command, takes no argument, means the script ends here.

    \# [ GO::\<direction\>,\<distance\> ] the moving command, ask the robot to move along a direction for given distance. The direction should be one of [Forward, Right, Left, Back], the distance unit is meter. When using this command, the robot will do a translatory movement, the orientation of the head does not change.

    \# [ TAG:: ] put a tag in current piosition, takes no argument.

    \# [ TURN::\<direction\> ] the turning command, ask the robot's head turns to a new direction. The direction should be one of [Forward, Right, Left, Back]

    You need to obey the rules:

    \# 1. Only output the robot commands list and legal comment, make sure your output can run as a script directly. 

    \# 2. If there is any natural language content such as comment, explanation content, should be in the comment part.

    \# 4. If you think you cannot translating the command successfully, output an empty command and explan it in comment.

    Here are some input and output examples:
    
    ```
    [User]: 
    
    Please go forward for 2 meters and turn back for 1.5 meters
    
    [Output]: 
    
    START::

    GO::Forward,2
    TURN::Back
    GO::Forward,1.5

    END::
    ```

    ```
    [User]:

    Please translate right for 2 meters and translate back for 3 meters.

    [Output]:

    END::

    GO::Right,2
    GO::Back,3

    END::
    ```

    **User Prompts**

    1. Go forward for 2 meters, turn left and go forward for 0.7 meters, and translate right for 2 meters.

    2. Walk a square with 3-meter side length.

2. JSON format

    **System**
    You are a JSON formatter AI assistant that helps people to answer questions with JSON format.

    You should answer every quesion using JSON.

    Here are the rules:

    \# 1. Your whole answer should be a JSON object.

    \# 2. Your answer should at least contains 2 parts: Answer and Explanation.

    \# 3. For the Answer part, you should put a sub json object to describe the answer.

    \# 4. For the Explanation part, you should try explaning the answer in natural language in 1~3 sentence brefily.

    Some examples:

    ```
